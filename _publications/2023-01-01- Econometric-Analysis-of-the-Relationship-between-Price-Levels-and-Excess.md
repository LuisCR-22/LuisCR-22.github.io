On July 23, 1923, the Bank of the Republic was founded. Its design followed the recommendations of the mission led by Edwin Kemmerer, the American advisor who, at that time, also led the establishment of central banks with similar characteristics in all the Andean countries of South America: Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. The centenary of this date is a great opportunity to reflect on the role that the Bank has played in Colombian economic history over the century since its foundation. Thanks to the support of the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and its president Sergio Diaz-Granados, we have been able to publish five essays in this book that are highly relevant to this reflection.

The first four were written by authors who, in addition to being widely recognized as historians, have also been important actors in Colombia's economic policy and have been directly linked to the Bank and its Board of Directors. José Antonio Ocampo chaired the Board twice as Minister of Finance, between August 1996 and November 1997 and between August 2022 and April 2023, and was co-director between 2018 and 2019. Miguel Urrutia was general manager for twelve years starting in 1993 and had previously been co-director since the creation of the Independent Board by the 1991 Constitution. Antonio Hernández Gamarra, on the other hand, was co-director between 1996 and 2001, and Carlos Caballero, who in this article is accompanied by Pilar Esguerra as co-author, was co-director between 2001 and 2003.
