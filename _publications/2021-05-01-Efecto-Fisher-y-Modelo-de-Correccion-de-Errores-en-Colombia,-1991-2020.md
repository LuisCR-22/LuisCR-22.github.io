This essay analyzes the Fisher effect in Colombia during the period 1991-2020. We use the interest rate of fixed-term deposits and the inflation rate on a monthly basis. The variables are non-stationary and there is a cointegration relationship between them. However, the transmission of inflation to the interest rate is not complete in the long term, therefore there is only a partial Fisher effect. Finally, an error correction model is carried out to identify the speed of adjustment between the short and long term.
