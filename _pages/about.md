Hello! My name is Luis, and I am an economist passionate about diversity, interdisciplinarity, and the expansion of knowledge. My academic and professional journey has enabled me to develop remarkable skills in research, critical thinking, and leadership, all founded on an unwavering commitment to quality and precision in data analysis and management. I have served as a consultant and professional at the World Bank, the Bank of the Republic (Colombia's Central Bank), and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia. Furthermore, I have had the privilege of working as a research assistant with scholars from prestigious universities, including Berkeley, Yale, and Cornell.

My research interests are focused on cutting-edge issues such as the impact of artificial intelligence on the labor market, the economics of education, the economics of discrimination, and migration challenges. I am driven by the desire to make a significant change and positively contribute to social well-being through my work as a researcher and economist.
